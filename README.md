Ethereal Architect
===============

A spooky utility for viewing and editing Minecraft Block and Item models.

**NOTE**: Architect is nowhere near done and doesn't properly render models, doesn't support parents, doesn't support textures, and is generally very unfinished. Don't try to use it yet.

At least Java 7 is required to run Ethereal Browser, and Java 8 is required to compile it.

Building
========
If on Linux, run `./gradlew`.
If on Windows, run `gradlew`.
A new zip in build/distributions will be created.


Screenshots

(The above screenshot is not representative of the overall plan for Architect; it is a simple test of the renderer.)
